# KnightCode IDE

A desktop IDE built on a fork of Zed, with KnightCode as its only agent,
its only inference path, and its only login. The IDE is Rust. The AI stack
stays in the KnightCode TypeScript packages and ships alongside it as a
headless engine binary.

The engine is a peer of the KnightCode CLI, not a mode of it. It owns
every provider request and every credential, the agent loop, tools, skills,
extensions, compaction, and session persistence. The IDE owns every pixel
and keystroke, buffers, which model is selected, the sign-in presentation,
and the engine process's lifetime. The IDE holds no API key, runs no OAuth
exchange, and stores no credential.

Three seams connect them. The agent panel speaks ACP over stdio. Buffer
inline assist, terminal inline assist, commit messages and thread titles
speak HTTP chat completions on loopback. Tab / next-edit prediction speaks
HTTP fill-in-the-middle. One login serves all three.

## Base

This `main` starts at Zed commit
`a57ba9b17c433ea1ebfdec8f649f4fa5a402d03b` (2026-09-10 17:54:38 UTC),
tagged here as `knightcode-base`.

Nearest upstream tags at that date: `v1.19.2` (stable) and
`v1.20.0-pre`. There was no `v1.21` tag. Rebasing onto `v1.21.0` when it
is cut is a merge of a tag that already contains this base.

Remote `upstream` is https://github.com/zed-industries/zed.

## Merging upstream

```text
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/v1.21.0
```

Conflicts are expected only in the files below. Everything else should
apply cleanly; if it does not, the extra conflict is a defect in the
fork surface.

| `crates/agent_ui/Cargo.toml` | two dependencies |

| `crates/agent_settings/src/agent_settings.rs`, `crates/sidebar/src/sidebar_tests.rs`, `crates/zed/src/zed.rs` tests | test-only: follow the editor-layout default, or pin the agent preset where a test exercises the layout toggle |
| `crates/zed/src/zed/app_menus.rs` | application menu name and About; the Help menu |
| `crates/zed/Cargo.toml` | two dependencies; `agent_servers` and `command_palette_hooks` made plain dependencies; version `0.1.0`; four bundle metadata blocks |
| `crates/zed/RELEASE_CHANNEL` | `stable` |
| `crates/zed/KNIGHTCODE_REF` | new file, the KnightCode commit a release builds the engine from |
| `crates/agent/src/agent.rs` | one string |

| `crates/paths/src/paths.rs` | `APP_NAME` |

| `crates/util/src/util.rs` | the installed launcher's name, for git's askpass |
| `crates/auto_update/src/auto_update.rs`, `crates/auto_update/Cargo.toml` | the feed URL and query, the release signature check and its key, the macOS and Linux bundle names, release-note links; three dependencies, and `db`'s test support so the crate's tests run on their own |
| `crates/auto_update_ui/src/auto_update_ui.rs` | the update notification opens the release page |
| `crates/auto_update_helper/src/` | the installed file names, the `engine` directory, strings |
| `crates/zed/resources/*.png`, `Document.icns`, `windows/*.ico` | generated by `apps/desktop/scripts/generate-icons.py` in the KnightCode repository; on conflict, keep ours |
| `crates/zed/resources/info/Permissions.plist`, `DocumentTypes.plist` | the application's name |
| `crates/zed/resources/zed.desktop.in` | comment, keywords, URL scheme |
| `crates/zed/resources/windows/zed.iss` | publisher, licence page, engine payload, no appx, URL scheme |
| `crates/zed/resources/windows/zed.sh` | the launcher it calls |
| `script/bundle-windows.ps1` | identity, engine staging, drops, Visual Studio and Inno Setup lookup |
| `script/bundle-mac`, `script/bundle-linux` | identity, engine staging, drops; the copied binary is named `KnightCode` / `knightcode` so the process a user sees is ours, and the licences and `NOTICE` ship in the payload |
| `script/install.sh`, `script/install-linux`, `script/uninstall.sh` | names and paths; no download |
| `crates/cli/src/main.rs` | the installed executable's name, and where the app binary is resolved from |
| `crates/auto_update/src/auto_update.rs` | the Linux install path the updater rsyncs over follows the bundle's binary name |
| `assets/settings/default.json` | six keys — the three from WP03/WP05, plus `telemetry.metrics` and `telemetry.diagnostics` off and `auto_install_extensions` empty — the editor panel layout (file tree, outline, git and collab left; agent panel and threads sidebar right), and the product name in every comment |
| `assets/settings/initial_user_settings.json`, `assets/keymaps/*.json` | headers and comments |
| `assets/icons/ai_zed.svg`, `zed_agent.svg`, `zed_agent_two.svg`, `zed_src_custom.svg`, `zed_predict*.svg`, `assets/images/zed_logo.svg` | the KnightCode mark, generated by `apps/desktop/scripts/generate-icons.py` in the KnightCode repository. The file names are internal identifiers behind `IconName` and `VectorName`, so keeping them fixes every call site without a conflict; on conflict, keep ours |
| `NOTICE`, `legal/` | the GPL-3 §5 notice, and our own terms, privacy policy and subprocessor list in place of Zed Industries' |
| `script/check-branding.sh`, `script/branding-allowlist.txt` | new; the gate that keeps new user-visible Zed strings out |
| `.github/workflows/knightcode.yml` | the branding gate, and the crates the test job covers |
| `Cargo.toml` | four members, five workspace dependencies |
| `Cargo.lock` | lockfile |

Nothing in `editor`, `project`, `workspace`, `terminal`, `git`, `vim`, or
`gpui`.

After every merge, compare `acp_thread::AgentConnection` with the
delegating `impl` in `crates/knightcode_agent/src/connection.rs`. A method
upstream adds with a default body compiles without a delegation, and then
the default silently disables that feature for KnightCode; add the
delegation for every new method.

## Building

```text
cargo build -p zed
```

The first build on Windows is long and the target directory is large.
Windows prerequisites are documented in
[`docs/src/development/windows.md`](docs/src/development/windows.md).
The toolchain is the one pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. On a 16-thread,
32 GB machine a cold build at the default job count crashed `rustc`, and a
running Zed with it, with `0xc0000409`; `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4` did not.

`crates/zed/RELEASE_CHANNEL` is `stable`, so a debug build identifies as
the installed product and shares its single-instance lock. Set
`ZED_RELEASE_CHANNEL=dev` to run one beside an installed KnightCode.

## Packaging

`script/bundle-windows.ps1` (an Inno Setup installer), `script/bundle-mac`
(a `.dmg`) and `script/bundle-linux` (a tarball) build the installers. Each
reads `KNIGHTCODE_ENGINE_DIR`, the directory `bun run build:engine` writes
in the KnightCode repository (`packages/cli-<os>-<arch>/bin`), and ships the
engine and its runtime assets in `engine/` beside the IDE executable.

On Windows the script needs PowerShell 7 and Inno Setup 6:

```powershell
$env:KNIGHTCODE_ENGINE_DIR = "C:/path/to/knightcode/packages/cli-win32-x64/bin"
$env:CARGO_BUILD_JOBS = "4"
pwsh script/bundle-windows.ps1
```

It writes `target/KnightCode-x86_64.exe`.

Not built, on purpose: `remote_server`, the Windows 11 shell extension, code
signing and the Sentry upload; each script says why.

## Releases and updates

`.github/workflows/knightcode-release.yml` builds five installers: Windows
x86_64, macOS aarch64 and x86_64, and Linux x86_64 and aarch64. Each carries
the engine built from the KnightCode commit in `crates/zed/KNIGHTCODE_REF`.
The publish job signs the SHA-256 digest of every file with the Ed25519 key
in the `KNIGHTCODE_UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY` secret and attaches `<file>.sig` beside
it.

To release, open that workflow in the Actions tab and choose **Run workflow**
on `main`:

- **bump**: `patch`, `minor` or `major` raises `version` in
  `crates/zed/Cargo.toml`. `current` releases the version already there, for
  example once its prereleases have been tried.
- **engine**: the KnightCode branch, tag or commit to build the engine from.
  It is resolved to a commit and written to `crates/zed/KNIGHTCODE_REF`.
- **prerelease**: publishes `v<version>-rc.N` instead, which is never offered
  as an update.

The run commits the bump to `main` as `Release v<version>`, pushes the tag,
and builds. A stable release is created as a draft: install it from the
release page, then publish it. Installed IDEs only see published releases.
Pushing a `v<version>` tag by hand still builds; the tag must match `version`
in `crates/zed/Cargo.toml`.

An installed IDE asks `https://knightcode.dev/api/ide` for the newest
release every hour. That route, in the KnightCode repository under
`apps/web/app/api/ide`, answers with the installer of the newest
non-prerelease release for the platform and its signature. The IDE downloads
it, refuses it unless the signature verifies against the public key in
`crates/auto_update/src/auto_update.rs`, and installs it the way Zed does. On
Windows the installer stages the new files in `install\`, and
`tools\auto_update_helper.exe` swaps them in, `engine\` included, once the
IDE has quit. On macOS and Linux the new bundle is copied over the running
one with `rsync`.

Only a build made by a bundle script, which sets `ZED_BUNDLE`, checks for
updates. `KNIGHTCODE_UPDATE_URL` points a build at another feed for testing;
its releases must still carry the release key's signature. Losing that key
means every installed IDE refuses every later update, so keep a copy outside
GitHub.

The macOS and Linux bundles are built by the release workflow and have not
been run on a machine yet. The Linux aarch64 build runs on Ubuntu 24.04,
because the prebuilt libwebrtc for arm64 needs GCC 14's `libgcc_s`, so it
needs a distribution from 2024 or later.

## Pointing a development build at an engine

The IDE looks for `knightcode-engine` in this order: the
`knightcode.engine_path` setting (an absolute path), the
`KNIGHTCODE_ENGINE_PATH` environment variable, `knightcode-engine.exe`
(Windows) or `knightcode-engine` next to the IDE executable, then the same
name in an `engine` directory next to the IDE executable.

The installers use the last one. The engine reads a `package.json`, themes,
docs, native prebuilds and `photon_rs_bg.wasm` from beside itself, so it
ships in its own directory rather than loose in the install root:

```text
KnightCode.exe
engine/knightcode-engine.exe
engine/package.json, engine/theme/, engine/docs/, ...
```

Example in the user settings file:

```json
{
  "knightcode": {
    "engine_path": "C:/Users/you/knightcode/packages/cli-win32-x64/bin/knightcode-engine.exe"
  }
}
```

## Licence

The IDE is `GPL-3.0-or-later`, as any Zed fork must be; see
[`LICENSE-GPL`](LICENSE-GPL). The engine is a separate MIT program and is
not linked into this tree.
